and hundreds of mental patients have washed up in Ocean Haven,
a sleepy summer resort on the Jersey coast.
Creaking Victorian age hotels and boardinghouses are the new asylum.</p>
<p>It’s the opening of the tourist season, 1993.
Suffering from schizophrenia,
a fearful Sandford Metz is dropped off at the Grand View Hotel.
His young psychiatrist at Hillbrook, Dr. Zoe Sweet opposed his release.
She worries that he won’t take his meds and may be a danger.
But once Zoe’s patients walk out of her care and into the arms of society,
there’s little that she—or anyone, for that matter—can do.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Karl Bak stands ready to take in the tired, the poor, the insane.
Bak, the Rotary Club’s “Father of the Year,”
owns and operates the Grand View Hotel
plus a dozen other boardinghouses, a total of 650 beds.
A butcher back in his native Poland, Bak is a consummate innkeeper.
But with a set of secrets all his own,
this decorated pillar of the community may be in need of psychiatric care himself.</p>

The immediate social problem…compelling and disturbing,
when the “mainstreaming” of the afflicted by society
amounts to dumping them and walking away.
What is insanity like from the inside? (It’s)
a subject about which we’re all curious,
whether or not we care to admit it.
Poor Sandford Metz.
He’s to be pitied but that doesn’t mean he isn’t lethal.
No doubt there’s a terrible price to be paid for our voyeurism,
that he should never be looked upon as “entertainment.”

</blockquote></div><div class="content"><div id="excerpt" class="copy"><h2>Excerpt</h2><p>Cottage C was one of the seventeen cottages on the hospital grounds,
but the word “cottage” was a misnomer.
Three-story brick with bars and metal mesh over the windows,
they were mini-fortresses with an underground tunnel system connecting them.</p>
<p>Zoe searched through her hoop of keys
and unlocked a side entrance that opened into a small vestibule.
The same drill for the second door brought her inside the men&#39;s ward,
where any memory of the tranquil, fragrant hospital landscape was obliterated
by the din and reek of insanity.</p>
<p>Manic laughter, moans, whimpers, shrieks cut through the air.
The harsh smell of ammonia was pervasive—the default remedy
for the stench of patient accidents and acting-out with excrement and urine.</p>
<p>There were open dorms on either side of the hall. Men lay
in their beds, huddled in sleep or tossing or glaring at the ceiling.
The beds were separated by beige Formica lockers, padlocked.
Everything was locked down in the ward, even the toilet paper…</p>
<p>“I got all the books in my room, Doctor. Doctor—I got all the books!”
Robert Craft slouched by the dayroom entrance, his arms crossed over his chest
in a fierce bear-hug.</p>
<p>Zoe tipped an imaginary cap to him, thinking, I got all the books, too, Robert.
I got all the books and I still don&#39;t know a goddamn thing…</p>
</div></div><div class="content"><div id="about" class="copy"><h2>About Me</h2><p><em>Bedlam’s Banquet</em> is set in a fictional town loosely based on
my adopted hometown of Ocean Grove, New Jersey.
My husband and I discovered Ocean Grove
when we were just out of film school, newlywed.
We lived and worked in New York City
(John Sosenko is a camera operator in TV and films)
and I was a film editor.
We were drawn to the town as a summer getaway,
but eventually moved there to raise our son, Evan.</p>
<p>I have always been a writer.
As a documentary filmmaker I won NEH planning and scripting grants
for two separate documentary film projects.
While I lived in Ocean Grove, I was a community spokesperson
for historic preservation—interviewed numerous times by the
<em>New York Times,</em> on TV-shows, and by the regional press.
(Ocean Grove is a National and State Historic District.)
I co-authored a book, <em>The Home Renovator’s Guide</em> for a local audience
that sold 7,000 copies and won the Outstanding Journalism Award
from the NJ Planners Association.</p>
<p>After 9/11, the film industry was forced into hiatus
and John, Evan and I left the east coast for the west coast.
Here in the high desert with no view of the sea,
I fired up my computer to write a novel.
<em>Bedlam’s Banquet</em> is psychological fiction set in the fictional town
of Ocean Haven and the fictional psychiatric hospital of Hillbrook State.
But the whiff of truth remains.</p>
